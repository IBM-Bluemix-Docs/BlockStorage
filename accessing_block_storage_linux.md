# Connecting to MPIO iSCSI LUNs on Linux

These instructions are for RHEL6/Centos6. Notes for other OS were added, but this documentation does **not** cover all Linux distributions. If you're using another Linux operating systems, refer to documentation of your specific distribution and ensure that the multipath supports ALUA for path priority.

For example, you can find Ubuntu's instructions for iSCSI Initiator Configuration [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/iscsi-initiator.html){:new_window:} and DM-Multipath setup [here](https://help.ubuntu.com/lts/serverguide/multipath-setting-up-dm-multipath.html){:new_window}.

Before you start, make sure the host that is accessing the {{site.data.keyword.blockstoragefull}} volume was previously authorized through the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.
{: tip}

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} listing page, locate the new volume and click **Actions**.
2. Click **Authorize Host**.
3. From the list, select the host or hosts that can access the volume and click **Submit**.

## Mounting {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volumes

Following are the steps that are required to connect a Linux-based {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} Compute instance to a multipath input/output (MPIO) internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI) logical unit number (LUN).

The Host IQN, user name, password, and target address that are referenced in the instructions can be obtained from the **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} Details** screen in the [{{site.data.keyword.slportal}}](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window}.
{: tip}

It's best to run storage traffic on a VLAN, which bypasses the firewall. Running storage traffic through software firewalls increases latency and adversely affects storage performance.
{:important}

1. Install the iSCSI and multipath utilities to your host.
  - RHEL and CentOS
     ```
    yum install iscsi-initiator-utils device-mapper-multipath
    ```
    {: pre}

  - Ubuntu/Debian

    ```
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install multipath-tools
    ```
    {: pre}

2. Create or edit your multipath configuration file if it is needed.
  - RHEL 6 and CENTOS 6
    * Edit **/etc/multipath.conf** with the following minimum configuration.

      ```
      defaults {
      user_friendly_names no
      max_fds max
      flush_on_last_del yes
      queue_without_daemon no
      dev_loss_tmo infinity
      fast_io_fail_tmo 5
      }
      # All data under blacklist must be specific to your system.
      blacklist {
      wwid "SAdaptec*"
      devnode "^hd[a-z]"
      devnode "^(ram|raw|loop|fd|md|dm-|sr|scd|st)[0-9]*"
      devnode "^cciss.*"  
      }
      devices {
      device {
      vendor "NETAPP"
      product "LUN"
      path_grouping_policy group_by_prio
      features "3 queue_if_no_path pg_init_retries 50"
      prio "alua"
      path_checker tur
      failback immediate
      path_selector "round-robin 0"
      hardware_handler "1 alua"
      rr_weight uniform
      rr_min_io 128
      }
      }
      ```
      {: codeblock}

    - Restart iscsi and iscsid services so that the changes take effect.

      ```
      service iscsi restart
      service iscsid restart
      ```
      {: pre}

  - RHEL7 and CentOS7, `multipath.conf` can be blank as the OS has built-in configurations.
  - Ubuntu doesn't use `multipath.conf` because it's built into `multipath-tools`.

3. Load the multipath module, start multipath services, and set it start on boot.
  - RHEL 6
    ```
    modprobe dm-multipath
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    service multipathd start
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    chkconfig multipathd on
    ```
    {: pre}

  - CentOS 7
    ```
    modprobe dm-multipath
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    systemctl start multipathd
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    systemctl enable multipathd
    ```
    {: pre}

  - Ubuntu
    ```
    service multipath-tools start
    ```
    {: pre}

  - For other distributions, consult the OS vendor documentation.

4. Verify that multipath is working.
  - RHEL 6
    ```
    multipath -l
    ```
    {: pre}

    If it returns blank, it's working.
  - CentOS 7
    ```
    multipath -ll
    ```
    {: pre}

    RHEL 7 and CentOS 7 may return No fc_host device, which can be ignored.

5. Update `/etc/iscsi/initiatorname.iscsi` file with the IQN from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Enter the value as lowercase.
   ```
   InitiatorName=<value-from-the-Portal>
   ```
   {: pre}
6. Edit the CHAP settings in `/etc/iscsi/iscsid.conf` by using the user name and password from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. Use uppercase for CHAP names.
   ```
   node.session.auth.authmethod = CHAP
   node.session.auth.username = <Username-value-from-Portal>
   node.session.auth.password = <Password-value-from-Portal>
   discovery.sendtargets.auth.authmethod = CHAP
   discovery.sendtargets.auth.username = <Username-value-from-Portal>
   discovery.sendtargets.auth.password = <Password-value-from-Portal>
   ```
   {: codeblock}

   Leave the other CHAP settings commented. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} storage uses only one-way authentication. Do not enable Mutual CHAP.
   {:important}

7. Set iSCSI to start at boot and start it now.
  - RHEL 6
    ```
    chkconfig iscsi on
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    chkconfig iscsid on
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    service iscsi start
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    service iscsid start
    ```
    {: pre}

  - CentOS 7
    ```
    systemctl enable iscsi
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    systemctl enable iscsid
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    systemctl start iscsi
    ```
    {: pre}

    ```
    systemctl start iscsid
    ```
    {: pre}

   - Other distributions: consult the OS vendor documentation.

8. Discover the device by using the Target IP address that was obtained from the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.

   A. Run the discovery against the iSCSI array.
    ```
    iscsiadm -m discovery -t sendtargets -p <ip-value-from-SL-Portal>
    ```
    {: pre}

   B. Set the host to automatically log in to the iSCSI array.
    ```
    iscsiadm -m node -L automatic
    ```
    {: pre}

9. Verify that the host is logged in to the iSCSI array and maintained its sessions.
   ```
   iscsiadm -m session
   ```
   {: pre}

   ```
   multipath -l
   ```
   {: pre}

   This command reports the paths.

10. Verify that the device is connected. By default the device attaches to `/dev/mapper/mpathX` where X is the generated ID of the connected device.
    ```
    fdisk -l | grep /dev/mapper
    ```
    {: pre}
  This command reports something similar to the following example.
    ```
    Disk /dev/mapper/3600a0980383030523424457a4a695266: 73.0 GB, 73023881216 bytes
    ```
  The volume is now mounted and accessible on the host.

## Creating a file system (optional)

Follow these steps to create a file system on the newly mounted volume. A file system is necessary for most applications to use the volume. Use `fdisk` for drives that are less than 2 TB and `parted` for a disk bigger than 2 TB.

### Creating a file system with `fdisk`

1. Get the disk name.
   ```
   fdisk -l | grep /dev/mapper
   ```
   {: pre}
   The disk name that is returned looks similar to `/dev/mapper/XXX`.

2. Create a partition on the disk.

   ```
   fdisk /dev/mapper/XXX
   ```
   {: pre}

   The XXX represents the disk name returned in Step 1. <br />

   Scroll further down for the commands codes that are listed in the `fdisk` command table.
   {: tip}

3. Create a file system on the new partition.

   ```
   fdisk â€“l /dev/mapper/XXX
   ```
   {: pre}

   - The new partition is listed with the disk, similar to `XXXlp1`, followed by the size, Type (83), and Linux.
   - Take a note of the partition name, you need it in the next step. (The XXXlp1 represents the partition name.)
   - Create the file system:

     ```
     mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/XXXlp1
     ```
     {: pre}

4. Create a mount point for the file system, and mount it.
   - Create a partition name `PerfDisk` or where you want to mount the file system.

     ```
     mkdir /PerfDisk
     ```
     {: pre}

   - Mount the storage with the partition name.
     ```
     mount /dev/mapper/XXXlp1 /PerfDisk
     ```
     {: pre}

   - Check that you see your new file system listed.
     ```
     df -h
     ```
     {: pre}

5. Add the new file system to the system's `/etc/fstab` file to enable automatic mounting on boot.
   - Append the following line to the end of `/etc/fstab` (with the partition name from Step 3). <br />

     ```
     /dev/mapper/XXXlp1    /PerfDisk    ext3    defaults,_netdev    0    1
     ```
     {: pre}

### Creating a file system with  `parted`

On many Linux distributions, `parted` comes preinstalled. If it isn't included in your distro, you can install it with:
- Debian and Ubuntu
  ```
  sudo apt-get install parted  
  ```
  {: pre}

- RHEL and CentOS
  ```
  yum install parted  
  ```
  {: pre}


To create a file system with `parted` follow these steps.

1. Run `parted`.

   ```
   parted
   ```
   {: pre}

2. Create a partition on the disk.
   1. Unless it is specified otherwise, `parted` uses your primary drive, which is `/dev/sda` in most cases. Switch to the disk that you want to partition by using the command **select**. Replace **XXX** with your new device name.

      ```
      select /dev/mapper/XXX
      ```
      {: pre}

   2. Run `print` to confirm that you are on the right disk.

      ```
      print
      ```
      {: pre}

   3. Create a GPT partition table.

      ```
      mklabel gpt
      ```
      {: pre}

   4. `Parted` can be used to create primary and logical disk partitions, the steps that are involved are the same. To create a partition, `parted` uses `mkpart`. You can give it other parameters like **primary** or **logical** depending on the partition type that you want to create.<br />

   The listed units default to megabytes (MB), to create a 10 GB partition you start from 1 and end at 10000. You can also change the sizing units to terabytes by entering `unit TB` if you want to.
   {: tip}

      ```
      mkpart
      ```
      {: pre}

   5. Exit `parted` with `quit`.

      ```
      quit
      ```
      {: pre}

3. Create a file system on the new partition.

   ```
   mkfs.ext3 /dev/mapper/XXXlp1
   ```
   {: pre}

   It's important to select the right disk and partition when you run this command!<br />Verify the result by printing the partition table. Under file system column, you can see ext3.
   {:important}

4. Create a mount point for the file system and mount it.
   - Create a partition name `PerfDisk` or where you want to mount the file system.

     ```
     mkdir /PerfDisk
     ```
     {: pre}

   - Mount the storage with the partition name.

     ```
     mount /dev/mapper/XXXlp1 /PerfDisk
     ```
     {: pre}

   - Check that you see your new file system listed.

     ```
     df -h
     ```
     {: pre}

5. Add the new file system to the system's `/etc/fstab` file to enable automatic mounting on boot.
   - Append the following line to the end of `/etc/fstab` (by using the partition name from Step 3). <br />

     ```
     /dev/mapper/XXXlp1    /PerfDisk    ext3    defaults,_netdev    0    1
     ```
     {: pre}




## Verifying Whether MPIO is Configured Correctly in `*NIX` OSes

1. To check whether multipath is picking up the devices, list the devices. If it's configured correct, only two NETAPP devices show up.

  ```
  multipath -l
  ```
  {: pre}

  ```
  root@server:~# multipath -l
  3600a09803830304f3124457a45757067 dm-1 NETAPP,LUN C-Mode size=20G features='1 queue_if_no_path' hwhandler='0' wp=rw
  |-+- policy='round-robin 0' prio=-1 status=active`
  6:0:0:101 sdd 8:48 active undef running `-+- policy='round-robin 0' prio=-1 status=enabled`
  7:0:0:101 sde 8:64 active undef running
  ```

2. Check that the disks are present. There must be two disks with the same identifier, and a `/dev/mapper` listing of the same size with the same identifier. The `/dev/mapper` device is the one that multipath sets up.
  ```
  fdisk -l | grep Disk
  ```
  {: pre}
  
  - Example output of a correct configuration:

    ```
    root@server:~# fdisk -l | grep Disk
    Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes Disk identifier: 0x0009170d
    Disk /dev/sdc: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes Disk identifier: 0x2b5072d1
    Disk /dev/sdb: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes Disk identifier: 0x2b5072d1
    Disk /dev/mapper/3600a09803830304f3124457a45757066: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes Disk identifier: 0x2b5072d1
    ```
  - Example outputs of an incorrect configurations:
    
    ```
    No multipath output root@server:~# multipath -l root@server:~#
    ```
    
    ```
    root@server:~# fdisk -l | grep Disk
    Disk /dev/sda: 500.1 GB, 500107862016 bytes Disk identifier: 0x0009170d
    Disk /dev/sdc: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes Disk identifier: 0x2b5072d1
    Disk /dev/sdb: 21.5 GB, 21474836480 bytes Disk identifier: 0x2b5072d1
    ```

3. Confirm local discs are not included in the multipath devices. The following command shows the devices that are blacklisted.
   ```
   multipath -l -v 3 | grep sd <date and time>
   ```
   {: pre}
 
   ```
   root@server:~# multipath -l -v 3 | grep sd Feb 17 19:55:02
   | sda: device node name blacklisted Feb 17 19:55:02
   | sdb: device node name blacklisted Feb 17 19:55:02
   | sdc: device node name blacklisted Feb 17 19:55:02
   | sdd: device node name blacklisted Feb 17 19:55:02
   | sde: device node name blacklisted Feb 17 19:55:02
   ```

## Un-mounting  {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} volumes

1. Un-mount the file system.
   ```
   umount /dev/mapper/XXXlp1 /PerfDisk
   ```
   {: pre}

2. If you do not have any other volumes in that target portal, you can log out of the target.
   ```
   iscsiadm -m node -t <TARGET NAME> -p <PORTAL IP:PORT> --logout
   ```
   {: pre}
   
3. If you do not have any other volumes in that target portal, delete the target portal record to prevent future login attempts.
   ```
   iscsiadm -m node -o delete -t <TARGET IQN> -p <PORTAL IP:PORT>
   ```
   {: pre}
  
   For more information, see the [man page of iscsiadm](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iscsiadm).
