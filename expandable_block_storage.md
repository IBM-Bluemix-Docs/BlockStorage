# Expandable Block Storage Capacity

With this new feature, our current {{site.data.keyword.blockstoragefull}} users can expand the size of their existing {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} in GB increments up to 12 TB immediately. They don't need to create a duplicate or manually migrate data to a larger volume. There's no outage or lack of access to the storage while the resize is taking place. 

Billing for the volume is automatically updated to add the pro-rated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. The new full amount is then billed in the next billing cycle.

This feature is available in [select data centers](new-ibm-block-and-file-storage-location-and-features.html). 

## Why Take Advantage of Expandable Storage?

- **Cost management** â€“ You might know that there's potential for growth of your data, but you need a smaller amount of storage to start. The ability to expand allows our customers to save on costs of storage and then grow to accommodate their needs.  

- **Growing Storage needs** - Customers who experience rapid data growth need a way to quickly and easily increase the size of their storage to manage it.

## How does expanding storage capacity affect Replication?

The expand action on the primary storage results in automatic resizing of the replica. 

## Are There Any Limitations?

This feature is available for storage that is provisioned in [select data centers](new-ibm-block-and-file-storage-location-and-features.html) only. 

Storage that was provisioned in these data centers before the release of this feature (December 14, 2017) can be increased to 10 times its original size and no more. Storage that was provisioned after that date can be increased up to 12 TB. 

Existing size limitations for {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} provisioned with Endurance still apply (up to 4 TB for 10 IOPS tier and up to 12 TB for all other tiers).

## How can I tell whether my storage is encrypted?

Storage that was provisioned with enhanced capabilities is always encrypted-at-rest. You can easily tell that your storage is eligible if it has a "lock" icon next to it in the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}. 

## How can I resize my storage?

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, click **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}** OR from {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} catalog click **Infrastructure** > **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}**.
2. Select the LUN from the list and click **Actions** > **Modify LUN**
3. Enter the new storage size in GB.
4. Review your selection and the new pricing.
5. Click the **I have read the Master Service Agreement...** check box and click **Place Order**.
6. Your new storage allocation is available in a few minutes.
