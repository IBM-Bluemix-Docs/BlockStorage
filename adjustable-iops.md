# Adjusting IOPS

With this new feature, {{site.data.keyword.blockstoragefull}} storage users can adjust the IOPS of their existing {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}} immediately. They don't need to create a duplicate or manually copy data to new storage. Users don't experience any kind of outage or lack of access to the storage while the adjustment is taking place. 

Billing for the storage is updated to add the pro-rated difference of the new price to the current billing cycle. The full new amount is billed in the next billing cycle.


## Advantages of Adjustable IOPS

- Cost management â€“ Some clients might need high IOPS only during peak usage times. For example, a large retail store has peak usage during the holidays and might need higher IOPS rate on their storage then. However, they don't need higher IOPS in the middle of the summer. This feature allows them to manage their costs and pay for higher IOPS when they really need it.

## Limitations

This feature is available in [select data centers](new-ibm-block-and-file-storage-location-and-features.html) only.

Clients can't switch between Endurance and Performance when they adjust their IOPS. However, they can specify a new IOPS tier or IOPS level for their storage based on the following criteria/restrictions: 

- If original volume is Endurance 0.25 tier, IOPS tier cannot be updated.
- If original volume is Performance with < 0.30 IOPS/GB, options available include size and IOPS combinations that result in < 0.30 IOPS/GB only. 
- If original volume is Performance with >= 0.30 IOPS/GB, options available include size and iops combinations that result in >= 0.30 IOPS/GB only. Size (greater than or equal to original volume)

## Effect of IOPS adjustment on replication

If the volume has replication in place, the replica is automatically updated to match the IOPS selection of the primary. 

## Adjusting the IOPS on your Storage

1. Go to your list of {{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}
   - From the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}, click **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}**
   - From {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} catalog click **Infrastructure** > **Storage** > **{{site.data.keyword.blockstorageshort}}**.
2. Select the LUN from the list and click **Actions** > **Modify LUN**
3. Under **Storage IOPS Options**, make a new selection:
    - Endurance (Tiered IOPS): select an IOPS Tier greater than 0.25 IOPS/GB of your storage. You can increase the IOPS tier at any time. However, decreasing is available only once a month.
    - Performance (Allocated IOPS): specify new IOPS option for your storage by entering a value in the range 100-48,000 IOPS. (Be sure to look at any specific boundaries that are required by size in the order form.)
4. Review your selection and the new pricing.
5. Click the **I have read the Master Service Agreement...** check box and click **Place Order**.
6. Your new storage allocation is available in a few minutes.
